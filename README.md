# Serena's Hiking Trail Tracker!

## What will the application do?
The main goal of this application is to help users track details about completed trails, or log "bucket list" hikes that the user is planning to do in the future. Each trail will be able to be logged with its 
- *name* 
- *location* 
- *distance*
- *elevation gain* 
- *difficulty level* (easy, moderate, hard)
- *date completed* 

It will also calculate statistics about your hikes, such as the average difficulty level or distance of the hikes you complete. Users will also be able to add notes about their hike. Finally, users will be able to view all the trails logged, and filter (ie. by difficulty, location, or completion status) or sort (ie. by distance) their list!

## Who will use it?
Anyone who is into hiking and looking for a specific place to log information about their hikes! 

## Why is this project of interest to you?
Ever since I was young, I have been hiking with my parents. Almost every time we went on vacation, it would be a roadtrip to a national park such as **Banff** or **Yosemite**. However, as the years have gone by, it is hard for me to recall all the details of each of the trails I have been on. If I went back to these parks, I would not know which trails to go to again, nor would I know which hikes I would want to recommend to a friend. That's why I would love to make a **hiking trail tracker** -- not only to keep track of my own hikes, but also to help others in the hiking community organize and remember their adventures!
