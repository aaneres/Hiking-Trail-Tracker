# Serena's Hiking Trail Tracker!

## What will the application do?
The main goal of this application is to help users track details about completed trails. Each trail will be able to be logged with: 
- *name* 
- *location* 
- *distance (km)*
- *completion status*
- *date completed* 

## Who will use it?
Anyone who is into hiking and looking for a specific place to log information about their hikes! 

## Why is this project of interest to you?
Ever since I was young, I have been hiking with my parents. Almost every time we went on vacation, it would be a roadtrip to a national park such as **Banff** or **Yosemite**. However, as the years have gone by, it is hard for me to recall all the details of each of the trails I have been on. If I went back to these parks, I would not know which trails to go to again, nor would I know which hikes I would want to recommend to a friend. That's why I am making a **hiking trail tracker** — not only to keep track of my own hikes, but also to help others in the hiking community organize and remember their adventures!
